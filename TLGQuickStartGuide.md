# **Welcome to the Telos Launch Group!**

If you&#39;re reading this, your application to join the Telos Launch Group (&quot;TLG&quot;) has been reviewed and approved based on the merits of your and/or your team&#39;s experience, and expertise. The intent of this document is to help familiarize you with our tools and processes, so that you&#39;re able to jump right in. There&#39;s a lot of work to do, and we&#39;re excited to have you join us!

Note: TLG members are expected to _actively contribute_ towards the success of the Telos project, following up on their commitments, reporting on their progress, and being generally responsive and supportive to other TLG team members.

## Tools:

The TLG uses a variety of tools to both communicate and collaborate. These tools are the result of much research, debate, and good ol&#39; real world testing, and the resulting choices are what we believe is the &quot;best of breed&quot; to suite our team&#39;s unique needs.

Please familiarize yourself with these tools so you&#39;re able to hit the ground running:

## **Communication:**

Slack (https://slack.com) is our primary communication tool, and where the vast majority of our team&#39;s communication occurs. Meetings are announced, links are posted, team members are mentioned/notified, and resources are shared. Conversations are organized into &quot;channels&quot;, and each channel represents a workgroup (&quot;WG&quot;). Each channel/workgroup is managed by a chair, and a co-chair. The focus of each channel&#39;s is described in its &quot;purpose&quot;, so be sure and peruse all the channels, and then join the channels where you&#39;re able to contribute to the workgroup&#39;s goals.
Slack is available on web, desktop and mobile platforms. You can download and install Slack here: https://slack.com/downloads

## **Calendars:**

The TLG uses Teamup ([https://www.teamup.com](https://www.teamup.com)) to track and schedule our team&#39;s events. Each workgroup has its own calendar (ideally maintained by the WG&#39;s chair). Calendars can be viewed on both web and mobile platforms, as well as subscribed to via your favorite calendar app. You can find the calendar listings in the #resources Slack channel.

## **Collaboration:**

Our primary collaboration tool is G-Suite (https://gsuite.google.com). G-Suite allows for real-time collaboration, which is invaluable given the distributed and 24/7 nature of our team. Any and all documents are to be stored, organized, and shared via our communal Google Drive, with access permissions set as necessary (private/team/public, and edit/comment/read only), depending on the sensitivity of the content. Its crucial we continuously monitor our exposure, as many documents are drafts, and are not ready for public consumption, so if you&#39;re uncertain about the sensitivity/permissions of a document, be sure and ask the workgroup chair.

## **Meetings:**

Zoom ([https://zoom.us](https://zoom.us)) is an easy to use video conferencing tool which includes chat and screen sharing features. TLG weekly video calls are held using Zoom, as well as any impromptu meetings. Be sure to download and install Zoom, prior to joining any meeting. Meeting links are posted weekly in the appropriate Slack channels.

## **Project Management:**

Trello: [https://trello.com](https://trello.com): Trello is a simple tool used for task management. Each TLG workgroup has it&#39;s own &quot;board&quot;, wherein tasks for that WG are assigned, and tracked. TLG team members can request an invite to specific boards based on the workgroups they&#39;re participating in.

## **Compensation:**

The Telos Founders Rewards Pool (TFRP) provides compensation to TLG members in the form of TLOS tokens. The TLG uses a &quot;bounty system&quot; for calculating compensation. Tasks and milestones crucial to the success of Telos have been identified, and compensation rates and commissions calculated for each. These tasks are then represented as slices of a pie; the more impactful tasks equate to larger slices of the pie, while less impactful tasks equate to smaller slices.

- Slicing Pie app: [https://telos-slicing-pie.eosdetroit.io/user/sign-in](https://telos-slicing-pie.eosdetroit.io/user/sign-in)

TLG member&#39;s are expected to track time spent towards accomplishing these tasks, and submit this via the &quot;Slicing Pie&quot; bounty app. While you can use the time tracking application of your choice, Clockify is a free time tracking app that integrates with Trello: [https://clockify.me](https://clockify.me/)
