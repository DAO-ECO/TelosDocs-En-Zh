# eosBarcelona November 2018 Update

时光虽如箭，却赶不上EOSIO前进的脚步。自从我宣布成为EOS主网候选节点的那一刻起(参见 https://medium.com/eosbarcelona/ntroducing-eosbarcelona-d501086b5a19) 一场旋风般的冒险之旅就此展开。随着EOS的世界逐渐发展壮大，我有幸认识了不少志同道合的朋友，提高了自身的技术和修养 几个月前，我并未预料到EOS的生态会发展得如此迅速。一如突破新境界的武林高手，眨眼间陡增两年的功力。 自EOS主网上线以来，我接触到了很多令人大开眼界的事物， Telos这个分叉就是其中之一。

I am proud to have joined the Telos team and continue this incredible adventure into delegated proof of stake and EOSIO. I was wowed by the technology of EOS… the speed, the transactional capabilities, the possibilities it brought to blockchain… and now I have landed in a fantastic continuation of the adventure and into the Telos ecosystem as I announce my candidacy as a Telos Block Producer.

Being a Block Producer carries great responsibility. Responsibilities only delegated to those with strong moral magnitude, community spirit, and most importantly of all, transparency. I take these responsibilities head on as any quality block producer should which is why I am outlining my full and honest disclosure in this brief document.

I, Josep Rosich, am the sole proprietor of EOS Barcelona, owning the Block Producer node in entirety. I am completely self funded and no other interests or ownership stake exists.

Since I have joined the Telos project my infrastructure has evolved significantly. Wanting to be as secure and reliable as possible EOS Barcelona has bare-metal servers in Germany and Finland. All our servers use 100% green energy coming from hydropower or wind power sources which makes us fairly unique in the sense that we aim to reduce environmental impacts of our activities to the highest degree possible while keeping safety and security at the top of our priority list.

Additionally, EOS Barcelona recognises the need to scale in an ever growing Ecosystem so I am planning to hire two engineers to manage the infrastructure and foster tools and projects for the community in order to contribute and be a positive force within the Telos Ecosystem. I will hire advisors and contractors whenever they might be needed to fulfil various tasks as required in order to grow, succeed, and prosper. The full disclosure of current infrastructure can be found here should someone be curious about the specifics: <https://eos.barcelona/#infrastructure>

And I will ensure I update it as needed to retain honesty and transparency as any good block producer would.

I look forward to working with my colleagues to build a better, brighter future for Telos, the ecosystem as a whole, myself and all I encounter.

I aim to continue to operate with integrity, respect, and due diligence in all things related to Telos, EOS and my Block producing activities.

Respectfully yours,

Josep Rosich
